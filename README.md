# Cybernetics [![Awesome]

The following repo shows some  theory of applied Artifical Intelligence  to control different kind of systems. This was made with porpuse to share knowledge about this interesting topics;

All codes were made in Matlab with its tools of fuzzy logic, neural Networks and simulink, some of them were written in python with the help of libraries like tensorflow.  Feel free to send me a pull request or an issue to improve the code.

# Topics cover in this repo

 - Design and Control of systems based on  automatisms
 - Control Systems based on automatisms
 - Control Systems based on boolean relations
 - Design and Control of  Fussy Systems
 - Neural Networks
 - Time series and Neural Networks
 - Neural Networks and Image Processing
 - Neural Networks and Modeling of dynamic systems
 - Predictive Neural Control
 - Neural Control NARMA L2
 - ANFIS
 - ANFIS and Time series

## Some applications and projects shown in this repo are:
 - Magnetic Levitation Control
 - Inverted Pendulum Control
 - For each topic shown above there is an application
